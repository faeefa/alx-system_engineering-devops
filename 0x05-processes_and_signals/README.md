### File Description
* 0-what-is-my-pid - a Bash script that displays its own PID
* 1-list_your_processes - a Bash script that displays a list of currently running processes. Requirements: Must show all processes, for all users, including those which might not have a TTY, Display in a user-oriented format, Show process hierarchy.
* 2-show_your_bash_pid - Using your 1-list_your_processes exercise command, it's a Bash script that displays lines containing the bash word, thus allowing you to easily get the PID of your Bash process. Requirements:The third line of the script is # shellcheck disable=SC2009 (for more info about ignoring shellcheck error [here](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck/wiki/Ignore))
* 3-show_your_bash_pid_made_easy - a Bash script that displays the PID, along with the process name, of processes whose name contain the word bash.
* 4-to_infinity_and_beyond-  a Bash script that displays To infinity and beyond indefinitely.
* 5-dont_stop_me_now - to stop 4-to_infinity_and_beyond process we use ctrl+c in the previous file, there is actually another way to do this. This is a Bash script that stops 4-to_infinity_and_beyond process, using `kill`.
* 6-stop_me_if_you_can - a Bash script that stops 4-to_infinity_and_beyond process, without using `kill` or `killall`.
* 7-highlander - a Bash script that displays:a).**To infinity and beyond** indefinitely, With a sleep 2 in between each iteration, b).**I am invincible!!!** when receiving a SIGTERM signal.
* 67-stop_me_if_you_can - a copy of 6-stop_me_if_you_can script, that kills the 7-highlander process.
* 8-beheaded_process - a Bash script that kills the process 7-highlander.
* 100-process_and_pid_file - a Bash script that: Creates the file `/var/run/holbertonscript.pid` containing its PID, Displays **To infinity and beyond** indefinitely, Displays **I hate the kill command** when receiving a SIGTERM signal, Displays **Y U no love me?!** when receiving a SIGINT signal, Deletes the file `/var/run/holbertonscript.pid` and terminates itself when receiving a `SIGQUIT` or `SIGTERM` signal.
* 101-manage_my_process, manage_my_process
> Programs that are detached from the terminal and running in the
> background are called `**daemons**` or `**processes**`, need to be managed.
> The general minimum set of instructions is: `start`, `restart` and `stop`.
> The most popular way of doing so on Unix system is to use the init scripts.
* manage_my_process - Bash script that: Indefinitely writes **I am alive!** to the file `/tmp/my_process`. In between every **I am alive!** message, the program should pause for 2 seconds.
* 101-manage_my_process - a Bash (init) script that manages manage_my_process. Requirements: When passing the argument start: Starts manage_my_process, Creates a file containing its PID in /var/run/my_process.pid, Displays manage_my_process started.
When passing the argument stop: Stops manage_my_process, Deletes the file /var/run/my_process.pid, Displays manage_my_process stopped.
When passing the argument restart: Stops manage_my_process, Deletes the file /var/run/my_process.pid, Starts manage_my_process
Creates a file containing its PID in /var/run/my_process.pid, Displays manage_my_process restarted
* 102-zombie.c - creates 5 zombie processes. Requirements: For every zombie process created, it displays `Zombie process created, PID: ZOMBIE_PID`.
